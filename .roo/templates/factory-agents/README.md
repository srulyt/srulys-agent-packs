# Factory Agents - Generic Examples

**Philosophy**: Examples Only, Not Patterns

These files demonstrate TECHNICAL SYNTAX, not recommended structures.

## Files

| File | Shows |
|------|-------|
| [`example-roomode.md`](example-roomode.md) | YAML syntax for .roomodes entries |
| [`example-rules.md`](example-rules.md) | Markdown structure for rules files |
| [`skill-template/SKILL.md`](skill-template/SKILL.md) | How to write skills |

## How to Use These

### What These ARE

- Format references
- Syntax examples
- Field documentation

### What These ARE NOT

- Templates to copy
- Patterns to follow
- Structures to conform to

## Creative Design

The Factory Architect designs systems from first principles.
The Factory Engineer implements those designs creatively.

There are no "orchestrator templates" or "worker templates" because:
- Every system is unique
- Requirements drive design
- Patterns should emerge, not be imposed

## The Only Constraints

1. **Valid syntax** - YAML must parse, Markdown must render
2. **Boomerang return** - Sub-agents return to their caller
3. **Requirement fulfillment** - Design must address what's asked

Everything else is creative freedom.
